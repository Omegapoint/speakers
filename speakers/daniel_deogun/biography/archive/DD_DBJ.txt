Daniel Deogun and Dan Bergh Johnsson have collectively been working with security and development for several decades. They are developers at heart and understand that security is often a side-concern. They've also evolved work habits that enable them to develop systems in a way that promotes security while focusing on high-quality design habits â€“ something that's easier for developers to keep in mind during their daily work. Both are established international speakers and often present at conferences on topics regarding high-quality development as well as security.
