Domain Primitives in Action – Making it Secure by design

What are the basic blocks of which you build a domain? It is probably not integers, strings, and floats. Instead it might be things such as “room number,” “track,” or “time slot.” They might be simple, they might be complex, but they are the simplest things that still makes sense in your domain - these are your domain primitives. Obviously, value objects are a feasible way of implementing many domain primitives. But certainly not all value objects are primitives. In this session, we’ll dive into what domain primitives are and how they enable solutions that make your code Secure by Design. In addition, we’ll show how domain primitives in combination with context mapping gives you a powerful way to clean up legacy code — patterns that you could apply immediately.
